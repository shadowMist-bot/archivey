        Open the given archive member and return a readable binary stream.

        **Subclasses MUST implement this method.**

        **Guarantees for Implementers:**
        - This method is guaranteed to be called only for members where
          `member.is_file` is `True`, after any link resolution by
          `_resolve_member_to_open`. Subclasses do not need to re-check if the
          member is a file.
        - The `member` object passed will be an instance previously yielded by
          `iter_members_for_registration` (or its resolved target), so
          `member.raw_info` (if populated by the subclass) will be available.
        - If `streaming_only` is `True` and `for_iteration` is `True` (i.e.,
          called from `iter_members_with_streams`):
            - This method is called for a member that has just been yielded by
              the `self.iter_members()` chain to the caller of
              `iter_members_with_streams`.
            - The call occurs *before* `iter_members_with_streams` proceeds to the
              next member, ensuring the underlying archive's read position
              should be appropriate for sequential access to this member's data.
        - Note: Direct calls to the public `open()` method (which results in
          `for_iteration=False`) are blocked if `streaming_only` is `True`
          *before* this method is reached.

        Args:
            member: The `ArchiveMember` to open. This is the actual member
                to be opened (e.g., the target of a link, if a link was
                originally requested). Its `raw_info` attribute can be used to
                access the original library-specific member object.
            pwd: The password to use for decryption, if applicable. This might
                be different from the default archive password.
            for_iteration: A boolean hint. If True, this open request is part
                of a sequential iteration (e.g., via `iter_members_with_streams`).
                Subclasses can use this to optimize if opening for iteration
                is different or cheaper than a random access `open()` call.

        Returns:
            A readable `BinaryIO` stream for the member's content.

        Raises:
            ArchiveMemberCannotBeOpenedError: If the member cannot be opened (e.g., it's a directory).
            ArchiveEncryptedError: If the member is encrypted and the password is wrong or missing.
            ArchiveCorruptedError: If the archive data for this member is corrupted.
            ArchiveError: For other archive-related errors.
